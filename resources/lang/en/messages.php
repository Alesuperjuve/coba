    'makkah'=>'Makkah, the holy city of Muslims in Saudi Arabia, has a long history as a spiritual and cultural center. The Origin of Makkah: Makkah is believed to have existed since the time of Prophet Ibrahim and his son, Prophet Ismail. The story begins when Ibrahim took Hajar and Ismail to the barren valley of Makkah. After running out of water, Hajar ran between the hills of Safa and Marwah in search of water, until finally, the Zamzam well miraculously appeared to meet their needs.'
